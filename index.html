Season 2 chicken breasts with olive oil, salt, pepper, and optional Italian seasoning, then grill for 6–7 minutes per side until cooked through; slice after resting. In a pan, sauté minced garlic and chopped onion in olive oil, then add red pepper flakes and ¾ cup tomato paste. Cook for a couple of minutes, deglaze with ½ cup vodka, and let it simmer until reduced. Stir in ½ cup heavy cream and ¼ cup grated Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, and toss in the cooked pasta. Top with sliced grilled chicken and more Parmesan to serve.</td>
